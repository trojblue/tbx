unibox provides unified interface for common file operations

## Installation

```bash
pip install unibox
```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install unibox
```

If you're not using python 3.13, it's also recommended to install `pandas[performance]`:

```bash
pip install "pandas[performance]"
```


to update or remove project dependencies:

```bash

uv add requests

uv remove requests

# after adding new package: rerun
make setup
```


## Usage

import the lib:

```python
import unibox as ub
```


## Using Huggingface Backend

you can load and use a huggingface dataset directly with `hf://{username}/{daataset_repo}`:

```python
hf_dset = ub.loads("hf://incantor/aesthetic_eagle_5category_iter99")
df = hf_dset.to_pandas()
```

and upload a processed dataframe back to huggingface:

```python
df["new_col"] = "new changes"
ub.saves(df, "hf://datatmp/updated_repo")
```


## Dev notes

current concerns:

1. loads(): temp files could accumulate on global dir, and take up all of /tmp/; also concurrency issues
2. s3_backend: only one that takes a dir; should make others do the same

to get a coverage report, run:
```bash
pytest --cov=src/unibox --cov-report=term-missing tests
```

To build the docs:

```bash
make docs host=0.0.0.0

# or in debug mode:
make check-docs
```


migrating from unibox 0.4

no longer supported:

- `ub.traverses()`: removed handlers and `exclude_extensions` (`include_extensions` still works but depreciated with `exts`)
